            FlipaClip is a digital animation app that allows users to create 2D animations on their mobile devices. It was first released in 2012 and has since gained popularity among amateur and professional animators. The app features various drawing tools, layers, and frame-by-frame animation capabilities.

            Flipaclip has five main tools, The Pencil, The Eraser, The Lasso, The Paint, and the Text. The Pencil tool is the main tool which allows you to draw from 1 px to 150 px, It also allows you to change color anytime you like, another thing is the opacity which permits you to lower and higher the visibility. The second tool is the Eraser, It allows you to erase stuff but unlike the pencil tool you can also change the outside edges. The third tool is Lasso, it allows you to encircle what you've drawen and either remove it, change the size, or rotate it. The fourth tool is Paint, you can change the color along with adding Presets, which are basically a series of colors packed into one. The fifth one and the final one is the Text tool which allows you to make text and either increase or decrease the size.

            On August 11, 2018, Flipaclip uploaded the "FlipaClip Splash Contest Mashup" on Youtube. It was one of many MAPS/Contests that the channel uploaded. What happened was 15 various animators would be picked by them and they would animate the Flipaclip logo in one way or another. One example of this was "Draw, Animate, Share". Later on December 5, 2020 they uploaded "Draw A Smile", The idea of this contest was you to make a 15-30 second animation on what or who you love. There were 3 medals that decided how good your animation was, Gold, Sliver and Bronze. The top one would get the modt rewards while the Bronze got simple stuff like stickers or pins. Way Later in May 28, 2021 Flipaclip made yet another contest called "The Animatics" unlike the other two this one was made into multiples. The first one was made on May 28, the Second one on July 16, the Third one on September 4, and the last one on January 7 of the next year.
